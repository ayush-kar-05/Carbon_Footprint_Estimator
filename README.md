# Carbon_Footprint_Estimator
This project focuses on building an AI-powered system that estimates the carbon footprint of different crops to promote sustainable agricultural practices. By analyzing key factors such as rainfall, fertilizer usage, temperature, and crop yield, the system helps farmers and researchers make data-driven decisions for reducing environmental impact.
